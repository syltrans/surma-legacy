Surma L fonts for the Syloti Nagri script
=========================================

This file provides detailed information on the Surma L Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Surma L font and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Surma L is a family of three (Regular, Italic, Bold) TrueType fonts for the Syloti Nagri script. The fonts are Legacy-encoded, meaning that the symbols are mapped to normal Latin-script codepoints, not the appropriate Unicode codepoints. Note that text encoded to use this font will be imcompatible with Unicode, and unusable unless you have this font. We strongly recommend that you do not use this font if your application or browser supports Unicode.

A Unicode-based Sylheti font project is available at:
https://github.com/syltrans/surma/releases
